  <h2>Greek Epic Poetry</h2>
  <p>
    <q>
    So now all who escaped <em>death</em> in battle or by shipwreck had got
    safely home <b>except</b> <span id="main_character">Ulysses</span>,
    and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and country, was detained
    by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave and wanted to
    marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the
    gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then, however, when he
    was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all
    the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him
    without ceasing and would not let him get home.

  <h2>What is a Queue?</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    <q>In a <dfn><abbr title="First in, first out">FIFO</abbr></dfn> data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the
    first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a
    new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed
    before the new element can be removed. Often a peek or front operation is
    also entered, returning the value of the front element without dequeuing it.
    A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a
    sequential collection.</q>
