    <h1>Welcome to the Foodex team page</h1>
    <h2>App Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The “FooDex” web-application will solve various problems that arise when managing a collection of recipes. It will allow a user to keep a personalized collection of recipes - which they can add custom recipes to, or simply take from the provided catalogue of existing recipes. The main issues that FooDex will be addressing deals with the organization, consolidation, discovery, creation, editing and sharing of recipes.
    </p>
    <h2>Team Goals</h2>
    <p>
      We're a keen set of computer science students looking to flush away nearly everything we've learn about the web in order to rebuild our understanding of it. We plan to demostrate our new found web knowledge and skills by incremently building the Foodex web-application and applying the teachings of Professor Powell. At the end of the quarter, we hope that the web-application will be a valid representation of our growth as web developers.
